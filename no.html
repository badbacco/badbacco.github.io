<h2>How to say <b>NO</b> to tobacco</h2>
<p> Peer pressure or even pressure from anybody can be hard to overcome,but there is always a way too say no like simple excusses: Let's go play basketball, my mom needs me to go home,You need to feed your dog, or maybe just say you don't want to talk about it. Their are many reasons to say no like your teeth they will fall out. Also you get some pretty bad breath. You will get addicted and end up spending your money on this and not on what you want. </p>
